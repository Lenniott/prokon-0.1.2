page data is now being sent to the background script from the content script on button click in the panel.

we now need to vectorise the data and store it in chrome storage indexed by url. the data being stored is in the following format:
{type,content,selector}

the type is the html tag, the content is the text content of the tag, and the selector is the css selector that can be used to select the tag.

the data is also being sent to the background script with the url of the page.

next thing to do is embed the data into a vector and store the vector in the chrome storage. in the metadata for the vector we will store the url and the selector.

we need to ensure we can install langchain and that it workds with chrome extension.

we will being using a local embedding model and LLM using ollama in particular nomic-embed-text and tinyllama

first step is to install langchain and ollama in the extension.
